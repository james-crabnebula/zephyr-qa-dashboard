| Smoke | 46 | 0 | 0 | 46 | HIGH |
| Baseline | 74 | 0 | 12 | 86 | HIGH |

## Critical Findings

| ID | Test | Severity | Confidence | Status |
|----|------|----------|------------|--------|
| SET-08 | Package Manager registry error | CRITICAL | HIGH | BROKEN |
| TASK-03 | Tasks page structure changed | CRITICAL | HIGH | BROKEN |
| AUTH-* | All auth tests failing | HIGH | LOW | BLOCKED |
| CHAT-11 | Message persistence | HIGH | MEDIUM | BROKEN |
| SEC-01 | XSS test selector issue | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | INCONCLUSIVE |

### Confidence Reasoning

- **SET-08 HIGH:** Error message clearly visible in screenshot
- **TASK-03 HIGH:** DOM audit confirms no kanban columns
- **AUTH-* LOW:** Automation environment issue, not necessarily app bug
- **CHAT-11 MEDIUM:** Could be timing issue or actual bug
- **SEC-01 MEDIUM:** Passed in regressions, failed in security suite
