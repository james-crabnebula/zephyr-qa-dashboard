# General Observations

*Record any overall impressions, patterns, or issues noticed during testing.*

<thead>
<tr>
<th><p>Kanban area needs work, buggy.</p>
<p>Some UI problems need urgent fix, break actual usage.</p>
<p>Haven’t actually interacted with an agent yet? Should I have been able to?</p>
<p>Interesting and modern app. Is it supposed to be a whole remote workforce in one workflow app?</p>
<p>Not really sure how the Workflow editor fits into it, but the Kanban bit makes sense for task tracking, although I wonder if it will be fast enough ( as a tracking system ) for LLMs? Do they call back to the Kanban and update their tasks?</p></th>
